EMACS

The most important commands in Emacs:
* C-x C-c: Quit Emacs
* C-g: Cancel the current action
* C-x C-f: Open a file (whether or not it already exists)
* C-x C-s: Save a file
* C-x C-w: Write a file (probably more familiar to you as Save as...)
Cut, copy, paste:
* Highlight text with the mouse or by hitting C-Space to set a mark and then moving the cursor to highlight a region.
* C-w: Cut a highlighted region
* M-w: Copy a highlighted region
* C-k: Cut (kill) from the cursor to the end of the line
* C-y: Paste (yank)
Some other useful commands:
* C-x 2: Split the window into 2 buffers, one above the other (Use the mouse or C-x o to switch between them)
* C-x 0: Undo window-splitting so there is only 1 buffer
* C-x b: Switch to another buffer by entering its name
* C-x C-b: See a list of all current buffers
Getting help within Emacs: In addition to the help button/menu on the right...
* C-h: Hitting this will display a short message in the minibuffer: 𝙲-𝚑 (𝚃𝚢𝚙𝚎 ? 𝚏𝚘𝚛 𝚏𝚞𝚛𝚝𝚑𝚎𝚛 𝚘𝚙𝚝𝚒𝚘𝚗𝚜) .
* C-h b: Key bindings. This lists all key bindings that are valid for the current mode. Note that key bindings change from mode to mode.
* C-h a: Command apropos. After typing 𝙲-𝚑  a you can type a symbol and a buffer will appear that lists all symbols and functions that match that phrase.
